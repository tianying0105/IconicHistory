####Iconic History

Iconic History is a Chrome extension that visualizes your browser history as a favicon stack. It creates a favicon for each url you visited, and then compiles all favicons into a huge sequence based on access time. You can not only see all history in the past four months in a page, but also identify personal browsing habits through the straightforward visual presentation of your online life.

####How to install: 
1. Download the github repository and unzip it.
2. In chrome, go to chrome://extensions. Check the developer mode box at the top of the page.
3. Click "Load unpacked extension" and select the unzipped github repository (the folder with manifast.json).
4. Click the little black house icon next to your address bar to open the extension. If a prompt shows up and asks for permission to access browser history, please give permission.

####How to use:
Iconic history will display your browser history as a page full of favicons, where each favicon stands for a visit you paid to a webpage. Favicons are organized based on access times. You can hover over a favicon to see details of each visit (including title of the page & timestamp). Click on a favicon to revisit the page.

Iconic history also provides a bunch of filters to help you discover some interesting browsing habits. At the top right of the page, you can find favicons of your most visited sites and icons of four time periods. Click them to add / remove filters. I find filtering by time to be the most intereting (wooooooooo all the late night visits...), but other filters are pretty entertaining too.
